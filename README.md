# Brackeys-CubeRun-Game-Unity

This is a repository containing all the files from my project game **Cube Run**.<br>
Brackeys is a great YouTube channel for tutorials relating to Unity.This project is the result of following the beginners tutorials from [__How To Make Your First Video Game on Unity__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) from the channel.<br><br>
The user has the choice to write the game scripts in C# or in JavaScript either of which I had no prior experience with. I have written them in C# primarily because the tutorials employed C# and also because I was more curious to learn the language.<br>

You may want to host a __Unity3D__ project on GitHub just like me. I had a minor difficulty doing this having not used GitHub Desktop in the past. This is [a useful resource](https://www.studica.com/blog/how-to-setup-github-with-unity-step-by-step-instructions) I felt like including on how to do the aforementioned.
